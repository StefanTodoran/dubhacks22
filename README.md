By: Sho Kiami, Zach Chapman, Nicholas Bradley, Stefan Todoran.

Submitted to DubHacks'22.

Our app consists of 5 main parts:
1. Computer vision & image processing for receipt scanning.
2. Data set aggregation and synthesizing for food expiration data.
3. Algorithms for text parsing and search querying/filtering.
4. Calling API endpoints to gather recipe data.
5. Stunning and intuitive UI and data visualization for easy use.
